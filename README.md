# Make-script-for-Magma-Code-Distance-estimation
The GitHub repository contains a MATLAB application for generating a script for Magma Code Distance estimation using the Brouwer-Zimmerman method. The tool generates an unstructured matrix and is optimized for Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check (QC-LDPC) codes, as it is recommended to use their QC representation for faster Magma computation.

To learn more about Magma implementation, refer to "Searching for linear codes with large minimum distance" by Martin Grassl, published in the book "Discovering Mathematics with Magma" in 2006.

For more information on the Brouwer-Zimmerman method, refer to the following papers: "Bounds on Linear Codes" by Andries E. Brouwer, published in the Handbook of Coding Theory in 1998; "Integral Hecke Modules, Integral Generalized Reed-Muller Codes, and Linear Codes" by K.-H. Zimmermann, published as Technical Report 3-96 by Technische Universit√§t Hamburg-Harburg in 1996; and "Codierungstheorie: Konstruktionen und Anwendungen linearer Codes" by A. Betten, H. Fripertinger, A. Kerber, A. Wassermann, and K.-H. Zimmermann, published by Springer in 1998.

This tool can be useful for estimating the code distance of LDPC codes using the Brouwer-Zimmerman method and Magma computer algebra software http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/.
